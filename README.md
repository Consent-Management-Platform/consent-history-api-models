[![Generate API Docs](https://github.com/Consent-Management-Platform/consent-history-api-models/actions/workflows/generate-api-docs.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Consent-Management-Platform/consent-history-api-models/actions/workflows/generate-api-docs.yaml)

This package defines API models for the Consent History API.

See [latest v1 API documentation here](https://consent-management-platform.github.io/consent-history-api-models/v1/docs.html).

## Usage

To leverage the autogenerated Java classes from a Java Gradle project, merge the following code into your build.gradle.kts file:

```kotlin
repositories {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/Consent-Management-Platform/consent-history-api-models")
            credentials {
                username = project.findProperty("gpr.usr") as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_USERNAME")
                password = project.findProperty("gpr.key") as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
            }
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    // Consent history API models
    implementation("com.consentframework.consenthistory:consenthistory-api-models:0.1.0")
}
```

## Technologies
[Smithy](https://smithy.io) is used to produce protocol and technology agnostic API models that can be used to automatically generate:
* API specifications for various types of platforms
* API clients for various programming languages

[ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) is used to automatically generate API documentation from our API models.

[OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) is used to automatically generate Java data models and client code from our Smithy-generated OpenAPI spec.

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are used to automatically generate and deploy HTML API documentation to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) after changes are pushed to the main branch.

[GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) are used to release artifacts to a GitHub's version of Maven, so that the API models can be imported into other packages.

[Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org) is used to build the project and manage package dependencies.
